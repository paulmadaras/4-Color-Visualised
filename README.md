# 4-Color-Visualised
This project visualizes the 4-Color Theorem, allowing users to draw maps, compute adjacency, and apply a coloring algorithm. Built with Python, Pygame, and Mace4, it demonstrates that any planar map can be colored using at most four colors, ensuring no two adjacent regions share the same color.
